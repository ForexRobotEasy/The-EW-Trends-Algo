## Code Explanation

### List of Major Currency Pairs
The code starts by defining an array of major currency pairs. These currency pairs include 'EURUSD', 'GBPUSD', 'USDJPY', and 'USDCHF'.

```csharp
string[] currencyPairs = {'EURUSD', 'GBPUSD', 'USDJPY', 'USDCHF'};
```

### The Pearson Trend Algorithm
The algorithm uses the Pearson Trend algorithm to predict market trends. The implementation of this algorithm is not provided in the code. The function `ThePearsonTrend()` is responsible for predicting the market trend and returns a boolean value indicating whether the prediction is accurate or not.

```csharp
bool ThePearsonTrend()
{
    // Implementation of The Pearson Trend algorithm
    // ...
    
    // Return true if market trend is predicted accurately, otherwise false
    return true;
}
```

### Trade Execution Function
The `ExecuteTrade()` function is responsible for executing trades for a specified currency pair. It calculates the take profit and stop loss points, places the trade order, waits for the trade to be executed, monitors the trade status, and manages it accordingly. Finally, it closes the trade once the take profit or stop loss is reached, and logs the trade execution details.

```csharp
void ExecuteTrade(string currencyPair)
{
    // Calculate take profit and stop loss points
    double takeProfit = 6.5;
    double stopLoss = 30;
    
    // Place trade order for the specified currency pair
    // ...
    
    // Wait for trade to be executed
    // ...
    
    // Monitor trade status and manage it accordingly
    // ...
    
    // Close the trade once take profit or stop loss is reached
    // ...
    
    // Log trade execution details
    // ...
}
```

### Main Function
The `OnStart()` function is the main function that operates the EW Trends Algo. It loops through each currency pair and executes trades if the market trend is predicted accurately. After executing a trade for the current currency pair, it checks if another trade can be executed simultaneously for the next currency pair.

```csharp
void OnStart()
{
    // Loop through each currency pair and execute trades
    for(int i = 0; i < currencyPairs.Length(); i++)
    {
        // Check if market trend is predicted accurately
        if(ThePearsonTrend())
        {
            // Execute trade for the current currency pair
            ExecuteTrade(currencyPairs[i]);
            
            // Check if another trade can be executed simultaneously
            if(i < currencyPairs.Length() - 1 && ThePearsonTrend())
            {
                // Execute another trade for the next currency pair
                ExecuteTrade(currencyPairs[i+1]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
